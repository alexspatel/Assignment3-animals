For CSCI 262, Spring 2014, Assignment 3 



1) I worked on this assignment soley by myself
2) I had a hard time trying to add new nodes to the binary tree when 
	the user wanted to expand the game tree. I surmounted this challenge
	by using an additional two functions, using an output file to save the
	new material for the tree, and then reading from that output file to
	the new node.
3) I liked working with the binary tree concept, however, found it diffucult to 
	work around errors when they came up. 
4) I started working on this assignment as soon as I finished the Lab assignments,
	and worked on this assignment nearly 2 hours a day until it was due. I 
	would estimate a total of 12 hours working on this assignment.
5) I was able to implement the enlarge game tree feature directly into the 
	main user interface. When the user won the game, the console would
	ask the user the winning animal, then it would ask the user to write
	a question that would differentiate the winning animal from the program's
	final guess. With this information, a new question is swapped with the 
	program's guess, adding two leaves with the two possible answers.
